the paper focuses on investigating how the frontal and the prefrontal cortices of primates process information during complex problem solving tasks involving working memory.

Exp setup:
The researchers used monkeys as subjects and they trained the monkeys on a sequential spatial memory task (i.e. the ability to remmeber sequences/order/locations/positioning)
the task involved finding and remmebering one or two target location across multiple tasks

Neural recording:
They recorded neural activity from the PFC and PPC while monkeys performed the tasks

Task Structure:
the problem consisted of 4 cycles of trials
in cycle 1, monkeys searched for target locations
in cycle 2-4 they had to revisit the target location

Key findings:
observed cycles of goal silencing and reactivation in neural activity
target info was not maintained through sustained neural firing between trials, instead it was reactivated at the beginning of each new trial
PFC showed more comprehensive coding, representing past present and future targets
PPC focused more on immediate events and current targets

Additional experiments:
they compared neural activity in this task to a standard memory guided saccade task
this helped relate their fingings to the classical working memory paradigms

Analysis methods:
stat techniques like ANOVA, cross temporal decoding and PEV analysis

Implications:
the results challenge classical views of working memory as sustained neural firing
they suggest a more dynamic process of info maintainence and retrival in complicated/complex tasks
